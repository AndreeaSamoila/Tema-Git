<h1>The History of Coffee</h1>
<div>
    <ul>
        <li>An Ethiopian Legend</li>
        <p>Coffee grown worldwide can trace its heritage back centuries to the ancient coffee forests on the Ethiopian plateau. There, legend says the goat herder Kaldi first discovered the potential of these beloved beans. </p>
        <li>The Arabian Peninsula</li>
        <p>Coffee cultivation and trade began on the Arabian Peninsula.  By the 15th century, coffee was being grown in the Yemeni district of Arabia and by the 16th century it was known in Persia, Egypt, Syria, and Turkey.</p>
        <li>Coffee Comes to Europe</li>
        <p>European travelers to the Near East brought back stories of an unusual dark black beverage. By the 17th century, coffee had made its way to Europe and was becoming popular across the continent. </p>
        <li>The New World</li>
        <p>In the mid-1600's, coffee was brought to New Amsterdam, later called New York by the British.

            Though coffee houses rapidly began to appear, tea continued to be the favored drink in the New World until 1773, when the colonists revolted against a heavy tax on tea imposed by King George III. The revolt, known as the Boston Tea Party, would forever change the American drinking preference to coffee. </p>
